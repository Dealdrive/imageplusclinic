        paragraph:"How Is Your Child‚Äôs Vision? Myopia (nearsightedness) means that your child can see close up, but have problems seeing things far away. Vision problems may be classified as refractive errors or non-refractive errors. Myopia is a refractive error. Myopia and other refractive errors are seen in 20 percent of children.  Treatment of myopia in childhood Myopia cannot be reversed or cured, but it can be treated. The goals of treatment are to improve your child's vision and prevent it from getting worse. This is important for protecting their eye health in the future, even if they still need glasses or contact lenses.  While a diagnosis of myopia might not sound serious, it's important to treat it with corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses) as soon as possible. Many parents are surprised when I explain that not doing so can put kids at risk for serious vision-related conditions later in life. Kindly visit our eye care facility in Uyo with your child.",
